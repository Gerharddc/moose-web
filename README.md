This is an incomplete 3D printer web interface. It allows for full control of a 3D printer with an included camera and WiFi adapter. The interface shows stats from the printer in realtime using a websocket connection. The interface allows allows for management of the system's WiFi interface. This interface is designed to interface with a moose-server instance running on an embedded Linux board connected to a RepRap 3D printer.

This project is not being maintened but is almost functional and looks really nice so it might be something for someone with the time to try and finish.
